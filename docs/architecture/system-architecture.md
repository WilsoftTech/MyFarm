Baseline required by source/request: Next.js App Router/React/TypeScript PWA, server application services/domain/repositories, Prisma and PostgreSQL/Supabase, Vercel, private object storage, Dexie/IndexedDB and custom sync. Proposed deployment is one modular application, not microservices.

Client owns entry, offline drafts, status and display. Server owns authority, tenant scope, calculations, version checks, atomic domain effects, receipt/audit/change-log. Database is authoritative; local data is cached or unacknowledged. Service worker caches the public app shell, not indiscriminate personalized server responses.

Proposed modules: identity/policy, registry, production, accounting, inventory, activities, sync, analytics, then later intelligence/assistant/voice/weather, officers/organizations/commerce/payments/profile/partners/vision/trace/forecasts/subscriptions/operations. Phase-specific slug directories are proposals; module ownership must be agreed before code. Modules expose application interfaces, not cross-module table access from UI.

Example expense flow: form schema → command with stable mutation ID → server auth/current FarmMember → validate enterprise/season scope → exact decimal rules → atomically expense + receipt + audit + change log → scoped result. Online and offline replay use the same command service.

Long external calls use durable intent/outbox plus reconciliation; no promise of in-memory background work completing after a serverless request. Add a durable worker/queue only where enabled provider workload needs one. [Stack](technology-stack.md), [database](database-architecture.md), [sync](offline-sync-architecture.md) and [ADRs](architecture-decisions.md) provide contracts.


## Phase1 implemented evidence and limits

Phase1 source implements UI → application → domain/contracts → scoped Prisma repository. Independent domain/provider boundary tests pass. Supabase auth/PG selected. Future accounting/stock functions are type-only interfaces; Dexie/service-worker/custom sync is not implemented.
